this machine learning model trained on a diverse set of close to medium range portraits of people. 

Use `portrait+ style` in your prompt (I recommend at the start)

The goal was to create a model with a consistent portrait composition and consistent eyes. See the batch example below for the consistency of the model's eyes. This model can do several styles, so you'll want to guide it along depending on your goals. Note below in the document that prompting celebrities works a bit differently than prompting generic characters, since real people have a more photoreal presence in the base 1.5 model. Also note that fantasy concepts, like cyberpunk people or wizards, will require more rigid prompting for photoreal styles than something common like a person in a park.

MODELING AGENCY C works best at a 1:1 aspect ratio, 

Please see [this document for parameters (prompt, sampler, seed, etc.) used for all example images above.](https://huggingface.co/wavymulder/portraitplus/resolve/main/parameters_for_samples.txt)
